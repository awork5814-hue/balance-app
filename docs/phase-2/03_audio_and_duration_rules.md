. Audio Branding — Background Soundscapes
Objective

Support autonomic regulation without stealing cognitive attention.

Audio must:

Reduce auditory distraction

Mask environmental noise

Never become the focus

2. Approved Audio Types (Only)
✅ White Noise

Use case:

Office environments

High external noise

Characteristics:

Flat frequency spectrum

Neutral masking

No rhythm, no variation

✅ Brown Noise (Preferred Default)

Use case:

Focused regulation

Nervous system calming

Characteristics:

Low-frequency weighted

Less hiss than white noise

Feels “grounded” without being emotional

Default selection for Alpha

✅ Silence

Use case:

Public spaces

User preference

Headphone-free usage

Silence is a first-class option, not a fallback.

3. Explicitly Forbidden Audio

🚫 No music
🚫 No melodies
🚫 No binaural beats
🚫 No nature sounds (waves, rain, birds)
🚫 No emotional sound cues

Reason:
These increase emotional interpretation and break work-mode focus.

4. Audio Behavior Rules

Audio starts only after user presses Play

Audio stops immediately on Pause or Exit

No fade-ins longer than 300ms

No looping artifacts or pulses

Audio is background support, never instructional.
